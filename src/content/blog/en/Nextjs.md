## 2. Simple Routing

Next.js's file-based routing system simplifies the creation of routes, allowing for a clear and organized project structure.

## 3. Automatic Optimization

Next.js automatically optimizes images and other assets, improving the performance and load speed of applications. It also supports incremental static regeneration for a better user experience.

## 4. Robust Ecosystem
