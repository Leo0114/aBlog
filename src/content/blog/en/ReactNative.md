## 2. Native Performance

React Native components translate to native widgets, providing a performance level close to native applications.

## 3. Hot Reloading

React Native offers hot reloading, which allows developers to see changes instantly without recompiling the entire application, improving development speed and efficiency.

## 4. Strong Community

With a large and active community, React Native provides extensive libraries, tools, and support, making it easier to find solutions and best practices.

In summary, React Native is an excellent choice for developers looking to build high-performance, cross-platform mobile applications with a single codebase.
